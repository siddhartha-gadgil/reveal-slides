				<h4>Eras for Computing in mathematics</h4>
				<ul>
					<li> Looking back from early April 2025: </li>
					<li class="fragment"> <strong>Computers</strong> (about 70 years): Computation, Symbolic
						Computation, Symbolic AI.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> <strong>Deep Learning:</strong> 10-15 years.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> <strong>ChatGPT (large-scale pretraining)</strong>: about 2 and a half years.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment"> Many improvements: better models, <em>agents</em>. </li>
					<li class="fragment"> <strong>"Thinking" models</strong>: 2-6 months.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> <strong>"Thinking"+ large-scale pretraining:</strong> about 2-3 weeks.</li>

				<h4> A proof: Sum of Angles in a Triangle</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment"> Consider a triangle $ABC$.</li>
					<img class="fragment" src="angle_sum.png" height="250" />
					<li class="fragment"> Draw a line through $A$ parallel to $BC$.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> Use equality of interior opposite angles.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> Use angles on a line add up to 180 degrees.</li>

				</ul>

			<section data-background-color="teal">
				<h4>Another proof: infinitely many primes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment"> For any $n$, we show that there exists a prime $p$ such that $p > n$.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> Consider the number $n!+1$, where $n! = 1 \times 2 \times \dots \times n$.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment"> Let $p$ be the smallest prime factor of $n!+1$.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment"> If $p \leq n$ then $p | n!$ so $p \nmid n!+1$.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> Hence $p$ is a prime greater than $n$.</li>

				<h4 id="what-went-into-proofs">What went into the proofs</h4>

						<p>Auxiliary Constructions:</p>

					<li class="fragment">
						<p>Deductions and Computations.</p>

				<h4 id="two-systems-for-thinking">Two systems for Thinking</h4>
				<p class="fragment">Our thinking is based on two systems:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">System 1: Intuitive, Associative, Automatic.
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">handles language, vision, sensorimotor tasks.</li>
							<li class="fragment">fast, but error prone.</li>
							<li class="fragment">In mathematics: auxiliary constructions, lemmas, relevant results.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">System 2: Analytical, Logical, Controlled.
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">handles reasoning, planning.</li>
							<li class="fragment">slow, but accurate.</li>
							<li class="fragment">In mathematics: computations, deductions.</li>

				<h4 id="moravec-paradox">Moravec Paradox</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">System 1 (including <em>sensorimotor system</em>), needs far more raw
						computational power than System 2.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Our brain (mostly System 1) performs about 100 trillion operations per second
						(about 100
						Teraflops) according
						to Moravec, far above the computation available in the 1990s.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Evolution has optimized our brain for many system-1 tasks.</li>
					<li class="fragment">We greatly underestimate/overestimate the difficulty of specific tasks for
						computers: based on our effort and the gap with experts.</li>

				<h3>Some computer-assisted proofs</h3>

					<li class="fragment"><strong>Four-colour problem:</strong> Any map can be coloured with at most $4$
						colours.</li>
					<li class="fragment"><strong>Kepler Conjecture:</strong> The most efficient way to pack spheres is

			<section data-transition="convex" data-background-color="teal">
				<h3> Robbins conjecture </h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment"> Robbins conjecture was a conjectural characterization of Boolean algebras in

						associativity and commutativity of $\vee$ and the Robbins equation
						$\neg(\neg(a\vee b)\vee \neg(a \vee \neg b)) = a$.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> This was conjectured in the 1930s, and finally proved in 1996 using the

				<h4 id="common-sense">Symbolic AI</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">This has been developed since the 1950s.</li>
					<li class="fragment">These are purely <strong>rule-based</strong> systems.</li>
					<li class="fragment">At the core of such <strong>Expert Systems</strong> are good algorithms and ways to organize data to search very fast.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Besides knowledge and fast algorithms, for success we also need enough
						<strong>raw power</strong>.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">Deep Blue, which defeated Gary Kasparov, was an <em>Expert system</em>, based on elaborate rules for judging
						strengths of positions.

			<section data-background-color="teal" data-transition="concave">
				<h4 id="tacit-knowledge">Deep Learning: tacit knowledge and intuition</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment"><strong>Tacit knowledge</strong> is the kind of knowledge that is difficult to
						transfer to another person by
						means of writing it down or verbalizing it.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Examples: riding a bicycle, speaking a language; evaluating positions in chess.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">Tacit knowledge is learnt from examples, as are other aspects of intuition.</li>
					<li class="fragment"><strong>Deep Learning</strong> allowed efficient learning from data, once the raw power was enough (which happened aroung 2012).</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section data-background-color="teal" data-transition="concave">
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Try different things (e.g. moves in a game) and learn from what works: no need of data. </li>
					<li class="fragment"><strong>Representation Learning:</strong> Learn a good <em>semantic</em> representation of the data, and a good output based on the representation. Can use synthetic tasks for the first step.</li>
					<li class="fragment"><strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> Use the same represention for many tasks. Training on one helps with the others.</li>
					<li class="fragment"><strong>Pretraining:</strong> Learn a representation on a massive scale for a single task: predict the next word. Was possible because of the <em>transformer</em> architecture.</li>

			<section data-transition="convex" data-background-color="#002b36">

							<li class="fragment">
								But tried to use the same proof for <em>infinitely many primes ending in $7$</em>,

							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">Models got better: GPT-4 turbo correctly proves that there are infinitely many
						primes ending in $7$.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Further, models were aided by agents: web search, Python interpreters,
						<em>function calling</em>.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">The next level are thinking models: o1, o3, DeepSeek-R1,
						Gemini-2-flash-thinking etc.</li>

						function such that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Prove that $f$ is unbounded.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Persistently wrong answers, even with guidance like split into cases.</li>

					<li class="fragment">Answered correctly: $P(X + Y > Z) = \frac{1}{2}$.</li>
					<li class="fragment">The model took 808 seconds, first trying many kinds of tricks to break up and integrate. 
					<li class="fragment">A little after 10 minutes it spotted the key idea: use <em>symmetry</em>.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">It then spent some time trying to reconcile the answer half with its previous answer 0.58.</em>

				<ul>
					<li>The model then decided "The mistake in the previous calculation was a result of incorrect
						integration steps, likely due to <em>human error</em> during the complex integration by parts
						and substitutions."</li>
					<li class="fragment">However, DeepSeek-R1 struggled with the Analysis problem mentioned earlier.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">The proof it gave split into cases and analysed these, but missed or messed up
						cases.</li>
					<li class="fragment">After 3-4 rounds of pointing out errors, it got to the proof.</li>

				<h4>Complementing AI?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">We would like to <em>automatically</em> check the output of the language models
